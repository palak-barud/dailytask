            <h1>Day -1 Task (Responsive Design)</h1>
            <p class="m-3">The Google story begins in 1995 at Stanford University. Larry Page was considering Stanford for grad
                school and Sergey Brin, a student there, was assigned to show him around.
<br>
                By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
                year they struck a partnership. Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used
                links to determine the importance of individual pages on the World Wide Web. They called this search
                engine Backrub.
<br>
                Soon after, Backrub was renamed Google (phew). The name was a play on the mathematical expression for
                the number 1 followed by 100 zeros and aptly reflected Larry and Sergey's mission “to organize the
                world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”
